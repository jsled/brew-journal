brew-journal
============

Herein are the sources for brew-journal, a python/django application for
tracking the state of homebrews.

This is intended to be an open-source web-service, being both a publically
available web site, but with the underlying source code fully open and
available.

Setup
-----

- get these sources, as you seem to have done.

$ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
$ source ./env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ ln -s settings-local.py settings.py

- make sure $(./manage.py test) passes

- create the database

  $ mysql [connection options] -e 'create database brew_journal';

- initial sync and migration

  $ ./manage.py syncdb
  # (answer "no" to the 'install django superuser' question; we have users in fixtures and db dumps instead)
  $ ./manage.py migrate

Load fixtures or restore a db dump
  $ ./manage.py loaddata app/fixtures/*.json
  $ ./manage.py dbshell < current.mysqldump

- run $(./manage.py runserver); hit <http://localhost:8000/> in your browser.

Selenium
--------

Get selenium-RC (1.0.3) from http://seleniumhq.org/.

Running the selenium tests is both manual and a bit hackyâ€¦

  $ java -jar selenium-server-1.0.3.jar &
  $ ./manage.py testserver &
  $ ./manage.py test app.SeleniumTest._testHappyPath

We start the django testserver, but then the first time we run the test, it
will seek to destroy and recreate the test DB underneath the still-running
test server.  Thankfully, this seems to work fine; it is quite lame. :p

TODO
----

Please see TODO for a combination of design docs, small/large TODO list and
bug tracker.  This file is in emacs' org-mode, so either use emacs and
org-mode, or try to follow the (simple) org-mode constraints.
