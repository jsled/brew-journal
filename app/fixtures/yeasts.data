WLP675 - Malolactic Bacteria - weird
Malolactic Fermentation is the conversion of malic acid to lactic acid by bacteria from the lactic acid bacteria family.  Lactic acid is less acidic than malic acid, which in turn decreases acidity and helps to soften and/or round out some of the flavors in wine. For more information on this culture click here for professionals and here for amateurs.
