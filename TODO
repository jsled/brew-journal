* Concepts
** Model Changes

- Grain -> Fermentable
  - extractable
    - grains
    - extract, sugar
  - literal
    - apple juice

- Recipe
  - volume -> {boil,end} volume
  - if all-grain:
    - water schedule
    - mash schedule

- RecipeHop
  - aau override
  - ui convenience for
    - fwh
    - dry-hopping

** Future Steps
*** Notes
Future steps are used a couple of ways:
- to schedule out a whole brew session, with rough times, &c.
- to schedule transition points in a fermentation session
  - to establish calendar/task/reminder entries


When operating with a mix of future and realized steps; let's assume a
time-stamped mix of future (f_) and real (r_) events:

   [f_0,  f_5, f_10, f_15]     | 4 future steps
-> [r_1,  f_5, f_10, f_15]     | realize the first step, about the right time
-> [r_1, r_12, f_10, f_15]     | realize the second step *after* the future 3rd step


At this point, it seems that next_step is f_10, but with its time adjusted to
be equal to the value of r_12.


Another option is that the second transition "pushes" the timestamps of the
other future steps out by the same amount; thus, that last transition would
instead effect:

-> [r_1, r_12, f_17, f_22]

This is most useful for a brew session which has its events scheduled at
fixed offsets from each other, where a slip should "cascade" to other
events.  E.g., if the mash starts 25 minutes late, it still takes an hour,
and all subsequent steps (the boil, hop additions, &c.) should get
pushed out 25 minutes.  However, on a different scale, there is no need for a
cascade.  If the mash/pitch happens 1 or 5 or even 12 hours later, I'm
probably still racking next Saturday, and kegging in 3 weeks.

What's the threshold?

- change steps on the same (literal) day
- change steps within the next N (=6?) hour window
- change steps until the inter-step distance is N (=6?) hours
- change steps while the magnitude of change is a fraction of the inter-step delta.

I like the the inter-step distance test, maybe with a threshold of 12 hours
or so.

Note that "push" and "pull" are the same, above.  We should probably say
"adjust" instead.

----------

Now, what about intermediate non-Future steps that get inserted, but are part
of the Step-relation depgraph?  For instance, we create future steps for
'strike' and 'boil', but then actually record realized steps for the
intervening 'mash' and 'sparge' steps?

If the immediately next Future step is in the (multi-level) tree of future
steps possible from the newly-added Step, we're in one of two situations:

- the new step is intentionally "splitting" the time the steps were
  allocating.

- the new step represents a delay, and the future steps should be pushed out;
  but it's not clear by how much, except if we take some "standard" schedules
  into account, where possible.

I don't think it's possible to handle this without being clever, and perhaps
too clever.  So, don't.


Now, if the new Realized step is (topologically and temporally) *after* the
first Future scheduled step, then we have a problem.  E.g., we have:

    [r_strike, f_mash, r_boil(new)]

We have a few options:

- ignore the "missed" Future step.  Don't consider it as a valid next step.
- Error/force the realization of the missed step.
- silently realize the missed step with its existing timestamp
  - maybe only iff its timestamp "makes sense" given the previous and
    currently-realized steps?

Next Steps
----------

At any given point, the most recently realized step "suggests" a set of
potential 'next' steps that can be taken.  Elements of this set may or may
not align with any temporally-next Future Steps.  If they do, then that
Future step should be taken as the Next step, and used in its place, though
this is a function of the user interface to a large degree.

"future" vs. future
-------------------

What is the essence of "future" steps?  They haven't happened, yet.

*** Use Cases
***** Historical Entry

- entry_date >> date
- dates are sequentially entered
- Step.date is all that matters
- there are never "future" steps

***** Immediate Entry

- entry_date ~~ date
- items are sequentially entered
- Step.date is all that matters
- "now" used as default for .date, value for .entry_date
- there are never "future" steps

***** Forward Planning

- entry_date << date
- items are sequentially entered
- Step date is all that matters

***** Forward Planning with After-The-Fact Fixup

- entry_date << date *and* entry_date > date

*** Use Cases redux

(basic future steps case)
- in the past, enter future steps; update future steps to "now", sequentially

- in the past, enter future steps; in the future, update now-past steps and now-future steps

- in the past, enter future steps;  in the far-future, update all-now-past steps
